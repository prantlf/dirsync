NAME
  Directory Content Synchronization Tool 1.2.0.0

SYNOPSIS
  Usage: dirsync [<options>] <source> <target>
   source: Path to the directory to read from.
   target: Path to the directory to write to.
  Options:
   -e, --exclude:<names>    - Comma-delimited list of exclusions; file or folder
                              names with optional nested level to exclude from
                              the operations.
   -h, --help               - Prints this usage information.
   -o, --operations:<names> - Comma-delimited list of operations to execute; all
                              is default.
  Operations to be performed in the target directory:
    all:    All three operations (default).
    delete: Delete items missing under the source directory.
    update: Update files different from the source directory.
    create: Create new files appeared in the source directory.
  An exclusion consists of a source file/folder name and of an optional directory
  nested level. 0 is for the first level and -1 for all levels (default).

DESCRIPTION
  Makes the content of a target directory the same as of the source one. Deletes
  extraneous, updates modified and creates new folders and files from, in and to
  the target directory in the optimal order. Works recursively in subdirectories.

  If you synchronize large directories having little free space on the target
  drive you may run out of space although he source and target drives are the
  same. If the first synchronizing operation is not the deletion updating and
  creating operations will exceed the free space before the obsolete files could
  be deleted. This tool deletes at first, then it updates changed files and at
  last it creates new files and folders to prevent the early exhaustion.

EXAMPLES
  Synchronize a single directory:
    dirsync D:\Movies E:\Movies
  Synchronize two directories preventing the space exhaustion on E: by performing
  deletions in all synchronized directories at first:
    dirsync -o=delete D:\Movies E:\Movies
    dirsync -o=delete D:\Music E:\Music
    dirsync -o=update,create D:\Movies E:\Movies
    dirsync -o=update,create D:\Music E:\Music
  Synchronize two directories excluding folders "Temp" at any nested level and
  the folder "Private" at the first level (Photos\Private):
    dirsync -e=Temp,Private:0 D:\Photos E:\Photos
